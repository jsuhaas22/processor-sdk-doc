*Understanding the MQTT setup of Smart Home*
   - All MQTT messages that are sent/received in this demo are to/from `broker.hivemq.com <https://broker.hivemq.com>`__ over port 8883.
   - MQTT communication example between the demo HMI and online MQTT client can be found in the following images:

      .. Image:: /images/ti-lvgl-demo-mqtt1.png
         :height: 300
      .. Image:: /images/ti-lvgl-demo-mqtt2.png
         :height: 300
   - Please note that the broker service used for this demo is free of charge, however, other broker services can be used as well and here
     are the necessary changes required in `ti-lvgl-demo/lv_port_linux/lvgl/demos/high_res/ <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ti-lvgl-demo.git/>`__

      .. code-block:: c

         /* In mqtt_temp_pub_init() function in adc.c AND
            in mqtt_sub_init() function in mqtt_sub.c*/

         //Remove the following line if using unencrypted communication, else,
         //Update with path of the broker certificate in the filesystem.
         mosquitto_tls_set(mosq, "/usr/share/ti-lvgl-demo/cert/AmazonRootCA1.pem", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

         //Replace 8883 with 1883 for unencrypted communication
         //Replace "broker.hivemq.com" with URL/IP of the broker to be used
         rc = mosquitto_connect(mosq, "broker.hivemq.com", 8883, 60);

   - All messages transmitted/received are SSL-encrypted MQTT messages.
   - To interact with the HMI remotely, user can use any interface (mobile-app/web-app/website) that implements transmitting/receiving MQTT
     messages over internet. To do this, just set broker to `broker.hivemq.com` on that interface and subscribe to or publish on the below
     mentioned topics:

      - Remote device can subscribe to topic: `SmartHome/temp`
      - Remote device can subscribe to topic: `SmartHome/evCharge`
      - Remote device can publish to topic: `SmartHome/volume`
      - Remote device can publish to topic: `SmartHome/led`

   - Note that there is no restriction on who can publish/subscribe to the above topics. **That means that one device can receive data published
     from some other remote application as well. Concurrent usage by other users on same MQTT topic may impact your GUI.** To minimize
     any issues, try to use unique MQTT topic names, like *<unique ID>/SmartHome/<widget>*. The topics can be changed at following
     locations in `ti-lvgl-demo/lv_port_linux/lvgl/demos/high_res/ <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ti-lvgl-demo.git/>`__:

      .. code-block:: c

         /* In  on_connect_vol_sub() function in mqtt_sub.c*/
         rc = mosquitto_subscribe(mosq, NULL, "SmartHome/volume", 1);
         :
         rc = mosquitto_subscribe(mosq, NULL, "SmartHome/led", 1);

         /* In  publish_sensor_data() function in adc.c*/
         rc = mosquitto_publish(mosq, NULL, "SmartHome/temp", strlen(payload), payload, 1, false);

         /* In  publish_evCharge_data() function in adc.c*/
         rc = mosquitto_publish(mosq, NULL, "SmartHome/evCharge", strlen(payload), payload, 1, false);

   .. note::

      By default CC33xx is configured at boot, so here are the steps that can be followed to enable it:

      .. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('SITARA')

          .. code-block:: console

             $ systemctl stop ti-lvgl-demo
             $ cd /usr/share/cc33xx
             $ ./sta_start.sh
             $ ./sta_connect.sh -s WPA-PSK -n <SSID> -p <PASSWORD>
             $ udhcpc -i wlan0
             $ systemctl start ti-lvgl-demo

      .. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('DebianSDK')

           .. code-block:: console

             $ systemctl stop ti-lvgl-demo
             $ cd /usr/share/cc33xx
             $ bash ./sta_start.sh
             $ bash ./sta_connect.sh -s WPA-PSK -n <SSID> -p <PASSWORD>
             $ udhcpc -i wlan0
             $ systemctl start ti-lvgl-demo

      For more details on how to enable CC33xx and connect to WiFi, visit :ref:`How to Enable M.2-CC33x1 in Linux <enable_m2cc3301>`

**The application includes the following widgets:**

*Widget#1: Climate Control*

 .. note::

      This feature will work on platforms that have on-chip ADC. Following is supported on AM62Lx

 - The indoor temperature in this widget displays the digital data obtained from ADC and display (data/10) on the widget.
 - The outdoor temperature below the indoor temperature shows the value of (data/10)-6.5, if it is positive, else, shows zero.
 - The indoor temperature is sent over SSL-encrypted MQTT messages under the topic `SmartHome/temp`
 - This demo uses channel 0 for ADC input. To change the channel being used, modify the following in
   `ti-lvgl-demo/lv_port_linux/lvgl/demos/high_res/adc.c <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ti-lvgl-demo.git/>`__

      .. code-block:: c

         FILE *fp = popen("cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio\:device0/in_voltage0_raw", "r");

*Widget#2: Charging*

 - The data shown in this widget is the same that is shown in the EV Charging HMI app.
 - This percentage completion data is also sent over SSL-encrypted MQTT messages under the topic `SmartHome/evCharge`

*Widget#3: Lock*

   .. note::

      Lock screen feature has only been enabled on AM62L

   - Sliding the lock to the right will lock the screen (disable all screen input)
   - To unlock, press the SW5: User Button on the TMDS62LEVM

         .. Image:: /images/ti-lvgl-demo-tmds62levm-usr-button.png
            :height: 200

*Widget#4: Speaker*

   - The play/pause button will play noise in the McASP device.
   - Custom audio filecan also be played by making necessary changes as shown below in
     `ti-lvgl-demo/lv_port_linux/lvgl/demos/high_res/audio.c <https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ti-lvgl-demo.git/>`__

      .. code-block:: c

         /* Copy the audio file in the SD file system */
         /* In audio_play() function in audio.c */

         //Modify the following as per the specification of the audio file
         rate     = 48000; //in Hz
         channels = 1;     //1: mono, 2:stereo
         seconds  = 1;     //duration of audio
         :
         :
         //Replace "/usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav" with the path of the audio file
         char *filename_wav = "/usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav";

   - Volume can be controlled from the vertical slider on the right-side of the widget.
   - Volume can also be set by sending values between 1 to 100 over MQTT topic `SmartHome/volume` from remote device over internet.

*Widget#5: Main Light*

   - The `Light temperature` slider will increase/decrease the User LED blinking frequency.
   - The left-end of slider (0 K) toggles LED every 250ms and the right-end of slider (20000 K) toggles LED every 20ms.
   - `Light temperature` can also be set by sending values between 0 to 20000 over MQTT topic `SmartHome/led` from remote device over internet.
   - In HMI, the slider `Light temperature` is not associated with any functionality but can be programmed be user to perform any function.

*Widget#6: Sensor Controls*

   - The buttons/sliders in this widget are not associated with any functionality but can be programmed by the user to perform any function.
